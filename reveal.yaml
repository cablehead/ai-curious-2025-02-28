    `prompt>`

    roger waters seems like complex character. focusing on his politics can you
    respond with two, terse paragraphs:

    the first should be as generous as possible,\
    and the 2nd as critical as possible

      Things are pretty rough right now.

      We've got existential human-made climate change, inequality.

      But it seems like we can't even begin to tackle these challenges for the lack
      of the ability to have a civil conversation.

    Today, I hope to persuade to try out two things:

    - Next time you're furious online, hit CMD-X \
      (pause and paste your reaction into an LLM -- what would actually help?)

    - Plant your thoughts in a Digital Garden\
      (grow, share thoughtfully, cultivate better conversations)

    The majority of our current online platforms are optimized for the **stream**:

    - Immediate reactions
    - Amplified outrage
    - Quick dismissal and dunking
    - Attention, not understanding

    In contrast to the **garden**:

    - Slow, thoughtful reflection
    - Nuanced growth of ideas
    - Iteration and deeper engagement
    - Cultivation of genuine understanding

  ## CMD-X

  **Capture your outrage.**
  Before posting an angry reply, **hit CMD-X**.

  **Paste it into an LLM** along with the provoking message. Ask for two paragraphs:

  1. A **generous interpretation**—what could they mean?
  2. A **skeptical view**—why are you triggered?

  **Break the cycle**, reflect deeply, and discover perspectives you'd otherwise miss.

        > There’s no time line. Did all this happen in one day or 10 years? Is it real or fabricated?

        _"What are you talking about! Does it matter? What's happening here isn't okay!"_

  Some thoughts on the original message:

  Cycling Professor's tone

  - "So, how is it going with that...", and the exclamation mark
  - "Let's watch one zebra crossing to find out!"

  are deeply inappropiate, and unhelpful.

  So what would help?

      **Plant them in a Digital Garden**

      - Your personal space for thoughtful reflection
      - Cultivate your ideas slowly, openly, and iteratively
      - Share intentionally, seek feedback, and deepen understanding
---
title: Next time you're furious online...

  **Hit CMD-X.**

  Reflect with an LLM, then plant your insights in a **Digital Garden**.

  It's a cycle: **Garden → LLM → Garden**.
